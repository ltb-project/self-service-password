.. _config_custompwdfield:

Custom Password Fields
======================

Background
----------

This Feature enables you to configure individiual Password Fields that are
independent to the actual user password.

For example, you have an old application that needs the password to be stored
with an insecure hash-algorithm, so you want to store it in an extra
LDAP-Attribute. Changing this password is possible with this feature.

Activation
----------

This feature is disabled by default. For enabling it, you have to define how many
custom password fields you want the tool to manage and some additional properties.

A minimal configuration could look like this:

.. code-block:: php

   $change_custompwdfield = array(
      array(
        'attribute' => "customPasswordField",
        'hash' => "MD5",
        'label' => "Custom password"
      )
   )

.. tip:: If you do not set an Arraykey in this configuration, the settings for the
   main password will be applied!

For more information, follow the steps mentioned below.

Main structure of the configuration array
-----------------------------------------

As seen above, the configuration consists of nested arrays. This is due to the
fact that it could be possible that one could need not only one custom password field, but
multiple.

So, if you want this feature to manage two custom password fields, you have to put two
arrays into the array $change_custompwdfield, one for each:

.. code-block:: php

   $change_custompwdfield = array(
      array(
         // everything belonging to password field one
      ),
      array(
         // everything belonging to password field two
      (
   )
